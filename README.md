## Tools used to create this app

### Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Materialize 

The [Materialze](https://materializecss.com/buttons.html) framework was used to create css for this app.<br />

Note: In this case I coppied the entire materialze css file (un-minimized) into the application for ease of use and to save time.  In a production application I'd look further into react-materialize tools.
