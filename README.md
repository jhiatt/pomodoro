## Tools used to create this app

### Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Materialize 

The [Materialze](https://materializecss.com/buttons.html) framework was used to create css for this app.<br />

Note: In this case I coppied the entire materialze css file (un-minimized) into the application for ease of use and to save time.  In a production application I'd look further into react-materialize tools.

## Launch App locally

Run 'npm start' from terminal. <br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.



## Run `yarn build` to prepare for production

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
